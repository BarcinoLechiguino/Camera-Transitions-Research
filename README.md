# Camera Transitions Research

This project was developed by [Ángel González J.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%C3%A1ngel-gonz%C3%A1lez-jim%C3%A9nez-147174196/?locale=es_ES) , a second year student of the [Bachelor's degrees in Video Game Design and Development at CITM/TTC](<https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/>) as of 31/03/2020. 

This content was generated for the Project II subject under the supervision of lecturer [Ramón Santamaria](<https://www.linkedin.com/in/raysan/>).



## About this project

This research's goal was to produce a functional scene and transition system in C++.

You can visit the research's website [here](<https://barcinolechiguino.github.io/Camera-Transitions-Research/>). All the information related to the research can be found there.

The project contains 8 different transitions, including fades, wipes and zoom, all of which can be interpolated linearly and non-linearly as well as be modified to some degree. (Ex: Wipe can transition from all sides of the screen)



**Software used to develop this project:**

* [Visual Studio 2019](<https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/es/vs/?rr=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F>)
* [SDL](<https://www.libsdl.org/>) & [STL](<http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/>) Libraries
* [Tiled](<https://www.mapeditor.org/>)
* [Online Converter](<https://www.onlineconverter.com/video-to-gif>)



## Test the project

Download the [release](<https://github.com/BarcinoLechiguino/Camera-Transitions-Research/releases>) and execute the Camera_Transitions_Research.exe. The available transitions options are:

* **LEFT CLICK:**  Move the camera to the mouse position. 
* **RIGHT CLICK:** Zoom to the mouse position transition to the next scene.
* **1 Key:** Cut Transition
* **2 Key:**  Fade In / Fade Out Transition.
* **3 Key:** Horizontal Slide Transition. 
* **4 Key:** Vertical Slide Transition.
* **5 Key:** Horizontal Wipe Transition.
* **6 Key:** Vertical Wipe Transition.
* **7 Key:**  Alternating Bars Transition.
* **8 Key:** Expanding Bars Transition.



* **Disclaimer:** All transitions starting from the Horizontal Slide Transition behave differently depending from which scene is being transitioned to: 

  * **All "Horizontal" Methods:**

    * **Transitioning from the first scene:** Transition from Left to Right.
    * **Transitioning from the second scene:** Transition from Right to Left.

  * **All "Vertical" Methods:**

    * **Transitioning from the first scene:** Transition from Top to Bottom.

    * **Transitioning from the second scene:** Transition from Bottom to Top.

      

  * **Both "Bars" Methods:** 

    * **Transitioning from the first scene:** Horizontal Bars.
    * **Transitioning from the second scene:** Vertical Bars.
